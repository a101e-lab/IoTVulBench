cve-id: CVE-2018-19988
info:
  name: dir823g and dir868l command injection
  description: In the /HNAP1/SetClientInfoDemo message, the AudioMute and AudioEnable
    parameters are vulnerable, and the vulnerabilities affect D-Link DIR-868L Rev.B
    2.05B02 devices. In the SetClientInfoDemo.php source code, the AudioMute and AudioEnble
    parameters are saved in the ShellPath script file without any regex checking.
    After the script file is executed, the command injection occurs. It needs to bypass
    the wget command option with a single quote. A vulnerable /HNAP1/SetClientInfoDemo
    XML message could have single quotes and backquotes in the AudioMute or AudioEnable
    element, such as the '`telnetd`' string.
