    and the vulnerability affects D-Link DIR-822 Rev.B 202KRb06 and DIR-822 Rev.C

    memory without any regex checking. And in the bwc_tc_spq_start, bwc_tc_wfq_start,
    and bwc_tc_adb_start functions of the bwcsvcs.php source code, the data in /bwc/entry:1/bandwidth
    and /bwc/entry:2/bandwidth is used with the tc command without any regex checking.
    A vulnerable /HNAP1/SetQoSSettings XML message could have shell metacharacters
    in the uplink element such as the `telnetd` string.
